# The creation of penning traps

This project is a part of review article "Evolution of Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance cells" 
written by E. Nikolaev and A. Lioznov.

To run the program you need SIMION (we use 8.1), and Python >=3.7. For 3D visualization 
the `ipyvolume` package is used, that is works only in jupyter notebook.

The example of jupyter notebooks are also on github
